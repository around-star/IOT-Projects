## IOT-Projects

1. Fire alarm will start when the temperature rises above 60'C or the Smoke intensity is more than 200. If the temperature rises above 65'C or smoke intensity increases above 220 with in 1 mins, water supply (i.e. servo motor) starts automatically. The alarm can be stopped by a person if the second condition does nt occur.
